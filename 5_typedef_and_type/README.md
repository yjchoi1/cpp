In C++, `typedef` is a keyword used to create an alias for an existing data type. This can make your code more readable, especially when dealing with complex or lengthy types. By using `typedef`, you can define a new name for a type, making it easier to use throughout your code.

For example:

```cpp
typedef int Integer;
```

This line creates a new alias `Integer` that you can use in place of `int`. Now, you can write:

```cpp
Integer x = 5;
```

This is functionally the same as writing `int x = 5;`, but `Integer` might make the code more understandable, especially in specific contexts.

`typedef` can be particularly useful when working with complex types like pointers, arrays, or function pointers. For instance:

```cpp
typedef int* IntPtr;
IntPtr p;  // This is easier to read than int* p;
```

In modern C++, `typedef` has been largely superseded by the `using` keyword, which serves the same purpose but with a slightly more flexible syntax. However, `typedef` is still widely used and is an important part of C++ legacy codebases.
