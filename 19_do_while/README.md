In C++, the primary difference between a `do-while` loop and a `while` loop lies in the order of execution and the condition check:

1. **`while` loop:**
   - The condition is checked **before** the loop body is executed.
   - If the condition is false initially, the loop body may never execute.

   ```cpp
   while (condition) {
       // Loop body
   }
   ```

2. **`do-while` loop:**
   - The loop body is executed **first** and then the condition is checked.
   - The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

   ```cpp
   do {
       // Loop body
   } while (condition);
   ```

### When is `do-while` more useful?

A `do-while` loop is more useful in scenarios where you want the loop body to execute at least once, regardless of the condition. Common use cases include:

- **Input validation:** When you need to prompt the user for input at least once and then repeatedly prompt until a valid input is received.
- **Menu selection:** When you display a menu and want to ensure that the menu is shown at least once before checking if the user wants to exit.

Example of `do-while` for input validation:

```cpp
int number;
do {
    std::cout << "Enter a positive number: ";
    std::cin >> number;
} while (number <= 0);
```

In this example, the prompt for input is shown at least once, ensuring that the user is asked for input even if the first condition check fails.
