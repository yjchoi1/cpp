# Brief Explanation of C++ Classes

A class in C++ is similar to a class in Python, but there are a few key differences in syntax and functionality.

**Basic Structure of a C++ Class:**

```cpp
class Car {
public:  // Public members can be accessed from outside the class
    std::string brand;
    int speed;

    // Constructor
    Car(std::string b, int s) {
        brand = b;
        speed = s;
    }

    // Method to display information
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << std::endl;
    }

private:  // Private members cannot be accessed directly from outside the class
    int secret_code;

    // Private method
    void update_code(int new_code) {
        secret_code = new_code;
    }
};
```

**Components:**
- **Class Definition**: Defined with the `class` keyword, followed by the class name (`Car` in this example).
- **Attributes and Methods**: Similar to Python, but their accessibility is controlled by `public` and `private` keywords.
- **Constructor**: Special function called when an object is created. In Python, this is done using `__init__`. In C++, it's simply a function with the same name as the class (`Car` in this example).

**Creating an Object and Using the Class:**
```cpp
int main() {
    Car myCar("Toyota", 100);  // Creating an object of Car class
    myCar.display();  // Calling a public method

    // myCar.secret_code = 1234;  // Error: secret_code is private
    // myCar.update_code(1234);  // Error: update_code() is private

    return 0;
}
```

# What is `public` and `private`?

In C++, `public` and `private` are **access specifiers** that control the accessibility of class members (attributes and methods).

- **`public`**:
  - Members declared under `public` can be accessed from outside the class.
  - You use `public` when you want the class's attributes and methods to be available to users of the class.
  - Equivalent to defining variables and methods in a Python class without any leading underscore.

  ```cpp
  class Example {
  public:
      int x;  // Public member
      void display() {
          std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
      }
  };

  int main() {
      Example ex;
      ex.x = 10;  // Allowed, because x is public
      ex.display();  // Allowed, because display() is public
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **`private`**:
  - Members declared under `private` can only be accessed from within the class itself. They are hidden from the outside world.
  - Use `private` to protect data or methods that should not be accessible or modified directly by outside code.
  - Equivalent to using a double underscore in Python (`__private_var`) to suggest it is for internal use only.

  ```cpp
  class Example {
  private:
      int y;  // Private member

  public:
      void setY(int value) {
          y = value;  // Allowed, because we're inside the class
      }

      int getY() {
          return y;  // Allowed, because we're inside the class
      }
  };

  int main() {
      Example ex;
      // ex.y = 10;  // Error: y is private, can't access directly

      ex.setY(10);  // Allowed, sets y through a public method
      std::cout << "y = " << ex.getY() << std::endl;  // Allowed, accesses y through a public method
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **`protected`**:
  - Similar to `private`, but accessible in derived classes (not as common for beginners, but worth noting).

**Python Comparison**:
- In Python, there’s no strict access control like in C++. However, conventionally:
  - Leading underscores (`_`) indicate “protected” members (intended for internal use).
  - Double leading underscores (`__`) can trigger name mangling to prevent accidental access but are still not truly private.
  
  ```python
  class Example:
      def __init__(self):
          self.public_var = 42
          self._protected_var = 84
          self.__private_var = 168
  
  obj = Example()
  print(obj.public_var)  # Accessing public variable
  print(obj._protected_var)  # Accessing "protected" variable
  # print(obj.__private_var)  # Error: Will raise AttributeError
  ```
